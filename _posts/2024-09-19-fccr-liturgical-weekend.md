## A Weekend of Renewal: Liturgical Workshops Inspire Faith and Deeper Understanding
The Filipino Catholic Community of Rotterdam recently organized a “Liturgical Weekend” aimed at refreshing and deepening our understanding of the basics of liturgy and catechism. Held across three days, from September 13-15, the event brought together faithful participants eager to learn and grow in their service to the Church. The workshops were led by Bro. Christian Caberoy, a seminarian with a rich background in music ministry, who guided attendees through a spiritual and educational journey that left a lasting impact.

The weekend was structured into three parts. On Friday evening, Bro. Christian conducted a workshop titled "Music and Liturgy" for the Music Ministry, hosted at the home of Paul and Mafe Marco in Schiedam. Here, Bro. Christian highlighted the role of music in the liturgy. He carefully explained the guidelines set out in Musicam Sacram, reminding participants that music is not just an accompaniment to the mass but an integral part of worship, designed to enhance the liturgical text. The focus was on selecting appropriate music for various liturgical seasons and ensuring that songs align with the message of the liturgy.

Saturday’s session, the "Liturgical Formation Workshop," was held at Sint Bavo Kerk in Slinge. It provided a broader perspective on the liturgy as a whole. Bro. Christian explained that liturgy is not only the actions we perform but primarily what God does through the celebration of the Eucharist. He introduced participants to the structure of the mass, the significance of the liturgical calendar, and the importance of using the proper liturgical colors and symbols in alignment with the church’s seasons and traditions. This workshop illuminated how every liturgical celebration is an action of Christ, in which the whole Church—past, present, heaven, and earth—participates.

The weekend concluded with a Sunday mass at H. Michael Kerk in Breda, bringing together all that was learned in a profound celebration of faith.

## An Engaged and Inspired Community
Participants were fully engaged throughout the workshops, asking questions and diving into discussions. The enthusiasm in the room reflected the community’s deep desire to grow in their understanding of the liturgy and their role within it. One particularly moving realization was the presence of Christ in every liturgical celebration, a concept that deeply resonated with many attendees. The recognition that the entire Church, across time and space, is united in the liturgy was a powerful moment for everyone involved.

## Personal Reflections and Renewed Purpose
For many, including myself, this weekend was not just an educational experience but a spiritual renewal. I left the workshops with a deepened sense of humility, realizing the depth of our faith and the privilege it is to serve at the altar. Understanding that we participate in the sacrifice, resurrection, and coming of Christ through the liturgy instilled in me a renewed sense of purpose. I am more conscious now of my actions and service, recognizing that while I may never be worthy of this role, I can strive to serve God through my service to His people.

## Moving Forward with Liturgical Knowledge
The weekend's greatest takeaway was the sense of unity and determination to follow the proper liturgical guidelines in our service. Bro. Christian’s teachings equipped us with the knowledge and inspiration to improve how we serve the community, not just in the mass but in all liturgical celebrations. We are now planning to make liturgical catechism workshops a regular part of our community activities, ensuring that this newfound understanding continues to grow and bear fruit.

## Final Thoughts
To those who were not able to attend, my message is simple: liturgy is at the heart of our faith. It is not just a set of rituals but a profound encounter with Christ, an invitation to participate in His saving work. Whether you serve in ministry or attend mass regularly, I encourage you to deepen your understanding of the liturgy. It is through this understanding that we truly appreciate the beauty and significance of every celebration and can fully enter into the mystery of our faith.

Dear Family, Friends, and FCCR Community,

As we gather to celebrate this joyful holiday season, I find myself reflecting on the many blessings that have graced my life this year. Foremost among these blessings are each of you—my family, friends, and community—who inspire me and strengthen my faith every day.

To my wife: You are my partner, my greatest supporter, and my constant source of strength. Your love, patience, and unwavering dedication to our family remind me daily of God’s love. Through the small acts of kindness and the sacrifices you make to care for our children and home, you embody what it means to serve selflessly. Thank you for walking beside me on this journey, for grounding me in faith, and for always encouraging me to be better. I am deeply grateful for you and the countless ways you make our lives brighter.

To my family: Thank you for being my rock and my refuge. Your love and unwavering support give me the strength to serve, dream, and grow. Whether in the simplicity of a shared meal or the beauty of family prayer, I see God’s hand at work in our lives, reminding me that the most profound blessings come in the quiet moments of togetherness.

To my friends: You are the companions who walk alongside me, through both challenges and triumphs. Your encouragement lifts me when I feel overwhelmed, and your joy reminds me of the beauty of friendship. Thank you for being a reflection of God’s love in my life.

To our beloved FCCR community:

Finding this community has been one of the greatest blessings in our lives. From the moment we joined, you welcomed not only us but also our children with open arms and warm hearts. You have given us a second home—a place where we can grow in faith, share our talents, and build lasting friendships.

As parents, it brings us so much joy to see our children embraced and included in this community. They are learning not only about their faith but also about the values of service, love, and togetherness that you all exemplify so beautifully. Your kindness, encouragement, and support have left a deep mark on our hearts, and for that, we are truly grateful.

It is in this spirit of gratitude that we continue to serve, knowing that the love and generosity we have received from this community inspire us to give back even more. Thank you for being a part of our journey and for allowing us to be part of yours.

This year, I’ve reflected often on what it means to serve. It’s easy to think that our talents or skills are the reasons we can serve the Lord. But the truth is far deeper and more humbling: it is not because of our abilities that we can serve, but because God, in His infinite mercy, allows us to serve despite our imperfections. Even when we feel unworthy or ill-equipped, God calls us, guides us, and uses us as His instruments. This realization has brought me immense peace and joy, knowing that our service is not about perfection but about trust and obedience to His will.

The holiday season reminds us of the simplicity of the manger and the humility of Christ’s birth. The Holy Family teaches us that greatness is found not in status or possessions but in love, sacrifice, and faith. May we strive to model these virtues in our lives, serving not just with our hands but with our hearts, and reaching out to those in need with compassion and grace.

As we look ahead to a new year, I pray that we continue to grow as individuals and as a community. May we nurture our talents, not for our glory but for His. May we support one another in faith and mission, and may we always find joy in serving God and each other.

May the love, joy, and peace of Christ fill your hearts and homes this Christmas and in the year to come. Let us remain steadfast in our journey, always seeking to love and serve as He has loved and served us.

With love and prayers,
Sai
